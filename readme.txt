== Changelog ==

= 0.9.2 =
* Bumped plugin version to 0.9.2.
* Standardized cache-busting across CAT assets by consistently using the plugin version for script/style registration and enqueueing.
* Added version query parameter to the glossary CPT menu icon asset to keep admin-side icon cache in sync with plugin releases.

= 0.9.1 =
* Added `excerpt` support to the glossary `term` post type for cleaner summary and SEO workflows.
* Added SEO meta description fallbacks that use the term excerpt when no description is set in Yoast or Rank Math.

= 0.9.0 =
* Added new SEO_Peacekeeper module to generate canonical DefinedTerm schema from CAT-owned term data.
* Added schema transport modes: auto, standalone, and off, with integrations for Yoast and Rank Math, plus SEOPress capability-aware handling.
* Added fallback behavior so unsupported SEO-plugin transports fall back to CAT standalone JSON-LD output.
* Added new term metadata support for authority/entity links (sameAs) and sources/references (citation mapping).
* Expanded block editor sidebar UI with “Related Authority Links” and “Sources and References” fields and clearer layperson guidance.
* Added field validation/sanitization hardening:
-- URL fields restricted to valid public http/https URLs
-- datePublished normalized to strict YYYY-MM-DD
* Improved semantic output for accessibility and machine parsing:
-- DefinedTerm wrapper uses aria-labelledby tied to stable <dfn id="...">
-- retained itemprop="name" and role="definition" structure
* Updated glossary auto-link behavior:
-- links only inside <p> and <li>
-- caps auto-linking to first two mentions
-- tooltip “Learn more” link now includes rel="help"
* Strengthened behavior test coverage for schema parity, sanitizers, transport adapters, and semantic markup contract.
* Updated internal architecture/contracts/testing docs to reflect current behavior and quality gates.

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial clean fork from wporg-glossary.
* Added nonce and capability checks for metabox saving.
* Switched to prefixed classes and plugin-specific CPT/meta keys.
* Replaced jQuery tooltip behavior with a vanilla JavaScript implementation.
* Added strict behavior/security test runner and documented quality gates.
